AIM: Write a Java program to create an Employee class where an Overloaded constructor initializes employee details.The default constructor should Initialize name as "Unknown" and salary as 0 and the second constructor initializes the name and sets a default salary.

public class Employee {
    String name;
    double salary;
    public Employee() {
        name = "Unknown";
        salary = 0;
    }
    public Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = 50000; 
      }
    public void DisplayEmployeeDetails() {
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Employee Salary: " + salary);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      
        Employee employee1 = new Employee();
        employee1.DisplayEmployeeDetails();
        Employee employee2 = new Employee("John Doe");
        employee2.DisplayEmployeeDetails();
